# This script iterates through a preset list of subreddits and uses their imgur rss feeds to extract images from them and arrange them into a grid with imagemagick; the resulting wallpaper can be combined with a slideshow wallpaper style to get a dynamic desktop background. Credit for the original idea goes to /u/Emwat1024. The default wallpaper is available free from http://www.heikotischler.com/?project=wallpaper
